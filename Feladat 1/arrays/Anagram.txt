Create a function named isAnagram() following your current language's style guide.
It should take two strings and return a boolean value depending on whether it's
an anagram or not.

The function should ignore the letter case as well as any non (latin) letter
characters, i.e. "Astronomer" is an anagram of "Moon starer!"

System.out.println(isAnagram("Astronomer", "Moon starer!"));
// should print: true
System.out.println(isAnagram("green", "fox"));
// should print: false
