Write a program that asks for an integer `size` from the standard input,
then it creates a two-dimensional array (of integers) of the specified
size (nxn) with the value of 1 on the main diagonal and the value of 0
everywhere else. Print the 2d array into the output

Example:

Please enter the array (matrix) size: 4
 1 0 0 0
 0 1 0 0
 0 0 1 0
 0 0 0 1
