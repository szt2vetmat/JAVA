// Write a program that stores a number and the user has to figure it out.
// The user can input guesses. After each guess the program responds
// with a message indicating whether the stored number is smaller or
// greater than the guess.
// The program ends (exits) when the user finds the stored number
//
// Example:
//
// Please enter your guess: 3
// The stored number is greater than 3
// Please enter your guess: 10
// The stored number is smaller than 10
// Please enter your guess: 8
// You have found the stored number 8
//
