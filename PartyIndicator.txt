// Write a program that asks for two numbers
// The first number represents the number of girls that comes to a party,
// the second represents the number of boys
//
// If the number of girls and boys are equal and 20 or more people are
// coming to the party, it should print: The party is excellent!
//
// If there are 20 or more people coming to the party but the girl - boy
// ratio is not 1-1, it should print: Quite a cool party!
//
// If there are fewer than 20 people coming,
// it should print: Average party...
//
// If no girls are coming, regardless the count of the people,
// it should print: Sausage party
//
// Please enter the number of girls: 15
// Please enter the number of boys: 25
